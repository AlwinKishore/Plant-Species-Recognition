Plant Species Recognition Using CNN In Deep Learning

The project "Plant species recognition using CNN in deep learning" aims to develop a 
deep learning-based model for accurately identifying and classifying plant species. The use of 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is employed in this project due to their effectiveness 
in handling image-based data. The model will be trained on a dataset of plant leaf images, 
which will be sourced from various datasets. Pre-processing techniques such as resizing, 
random horizontal flips, convert to tensor and normalization will be applied to each image in 
the dataset to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
The proposed model will utilize transfer learning, where a pre-trained CNN model will 
be fine-tuned to classify plant species. This approach is expected to improve the model's 
accuracy, reduce the training time, and mitigate overfitting. The effectiveness of the model will 
be evaluated using various performance metrics, including train and test accuracy. 
The project's outcome will be a highly accurate and efficient plant species recognition 
model that can be deployed in various applications, including plant conservation and 
agriculture. The successful development of this model will advance the field of plant 
recognition and contribute to the sustainable management of plant resources.
